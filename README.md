#Divide&Conquer

Divide and Conquer is a powerful algorithmic paradigm where a complex problem is broken down into smaller, more manageable subproblems. These subproblems are then solved independently, and their solutions are combined to obtain the 1 solution to the original problem. This approach often leads to efficient solutions for problems like sorting (Merge Sort, Quick Sort), searching (Binary Search)
